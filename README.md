# Dual Axis Chart

# What is dual axis chart in tableau

Dual-axis charts are particularly useful for analyzing two measures that have different scales.

In the case of measures with the same scale, they can share the same axis using the blend method. 

Blending measures in Tableau will consist of dragging one measure or axis and dropping it onto an existing axis.
